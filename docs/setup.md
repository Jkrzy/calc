## Setup

Setting up CALC locally without Docker is possible, but it requires
quite a few prerequisites. If the following instructions seem daunting,
you may want to check out our alternative [Docker instructions](docker.md).

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools and services installed to run CALC
locally:

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
  * If not using the [Docker-based development workflow](docker.md), make sure your system `python` command runs Python 3. You can check this by running `python --version`.
* [Node 6.13](https://nodejs.org/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
  * Install globally via `npm install -g yarn` or via another method described at [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
* [Postgres 9.5](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * It's easiest to have a local instance of it running on its default
    port, as this requires no extra configuration on the CALC side.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)
  * It's easiest to have a local instance of it running on its default
    port, as this requires no extra configuration on the CALC side.
  * For guidance on installing Redis, see
    [Installing Redis on Mac OSX][redis-osx] or
    [Installing Redis on Ubuntu][redis-ubuntu].

### Configuration

CALC is a [Django] project. You can configure everything by running:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to your tastes. If all your services are on their
default ports, you shouldn't need to change much here; if not, see
[Environment variables](environment.md) for details on
configuration.

### Creating the database

Assuming you haven't changed the database mentioned in the
your `.env` file's `DATABASE_URL` value from its default value,
you can create the Postgres database by running:

```sh
createdb hourglass
```

### Running the update script

Now run:

```sh
./update.sh
```

This script will install/update all Python and Node dependencies,
as well as apply any necessary database migrations.

You'll also want to run this script whenever you update your repository
via commands like `git pull` or `git checkout`.

### Loading data (optional)

After that, you can optionally load data by running:

```sh
./manage.py load_api_data --end-page=5
```

This will load about 1000 rates from the production CALC instance
into your local CALC instance.  You can increase the value passed
to the `--end-page` argument to increase the amount of data
that is copied over, or you can leave out the argument entirely
to transfer all of CALC's data, but it may take some time.

### Starting the development server

Now you can start the development server:

```sh
./manage.py runserver
```

Don't visit it just yet, though--first you'll need to start the static
asset build pipeline.

### Starting the static asset generator

In another terminal, you will also need to run `gulp` to watch and rebuild
static assets:

```sh
yarn gulp
```

### Starting the task runner

Also, in yet another terminal, you will want to run
the following to process all the tasks in the task queue:

```sh
python manage.py rqworker
```

### Starting the task scheduler (optional)

You can also start CALC's task scheduler in a separate terminal,
though it's not required:

```sh
IS_RQ_SCHEDULER=yup python manage.py rqscheduler
```

### Visiting the development server

Now you're ready to visit your local development site! Load
http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
